# Developing R Functions

---

# Functions 

Functions are defined by two components:

 - the arguments of the function
 - the body of the function that computes the result
 
They are created using `function()`

```{r}
t_statistic <- function(n) {
    x <- rnorm(n)
    y <- rnorm(n)
    t.test(x, y)$statistic
}
```
---

# Specified Arguments

*specified* arguments are those named in the function definition, e.g. 
in `rnorm()`

```{r}
args(rnorm)
```
the arguments are `n`, `mean` and `sd`.

`mean` and `sd` have been given default values in the function definition, but `n` has not, so the function fails if the user does not pass a value to `n`

```{r, error = TRUE}
rnorm()
```

---

# Name and Order of Arguments

The user can pass objects to these arguments using their names or by supplying unnamed values in the right order

```{r}
rnorm(5, 1, 10)
rnorm(5, sd = 10)
```

So, naming and order is important! Some guidelines:

- put compulsory arguments first, e.g. data
- put rarely used arguments last, e.g. tolerance setting
- use short but meaningful argument names
- if relevant, use the same argument names as similar functions

---

# Using Arguments

Arguments are used as objects in the function code.

A new environment is created each time the function is called, separate 
from the global workspace.

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- 1
y <- 3
f <- function(x, y){
    a <- 1
    x <- x + a
    x + y
}
f(x, y)
x
a
```
---

# Lexical Scoping

If an object is not defined within the function, or passed in as an argument, R looks for it in the *parent environment* where the function was defined

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- 1
y <- 3
f <- function(x){
    x + y
}
f(x)
rm(y)
f(x)
```
It is safest to use arguments rather than depend on global variables! 

---

# Unspecified Arguments

`...` or the *ellipsis* allow unspecified arguments to be passed to the function. 

This device is used by functions that work with arbitrary numbers of objects, e.g. 
```{r}
args(sum)
sum(1, 4, 10, 2)
```

It can also be used to pass on arguments to another function, e.g.
```{r}
t_statistic <- function(x, g, ...) {
    t.test(x ~ g, ...)$stat
}
```

---

# Using `...`

Arguments passed to `...` can be collected into a
list for further analysis

```{r}
f <- function(...){
    dots <- list(...)
    vapply(dots, mean, numeric(1), na.rm = TRUE)
}
x <- 1
y <- 2:3
f(x, y)
```
Similarly the objects could be concatenated using `c()`


---

# Return Values

By default, functions return the object created by the last line of code
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
    x <- x + 1
    log(x)
}
```

Alternatively `return()` can be used to terminate the function and return
a given object
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
    if (all(x > 0)) return(log(x))
    x[x <= 0] <- 0.1
    log(x)
}
```

Multiple objects can be returned in a list.

---

# Naming Functions

As with arguments, function names are important:

- use a name that describes what it returns (e.g. `t_statistic`) or what it does (e.g. `remove_na`)
- try to use one convention for combining words (e.g. snake case `t_statistic` or camel case `tStatistic`)
- avoid using the same name as other functions

---

# Side Effects

A side-effect is a change outside the function that occurs when the
function is run, e.g.

- plot to the graphics window or other device
- printing output to the console
- write data to a file

A function *can* have many side-effects and a return value, but it is 
best practice to have a separate function for each task, e.g creating a 
plot or a table.

Writing to file is usually best done outside a function.

---

# RStudio "`Extract Function`"

RStudio has a helper to turn code into a function:

1. Select the lines of code that will become the body of the function.
2. Select "`Code`" > "`Extract Function`" from the menu.
3. Enter the name of the new function in the dialog box.
4. Edit the arguments if required.
5. Add/edit the last line to specify the return value.

---

# Exercise 1

In the `qq_norm` chunk of `exercises.Rmd` there is some code to compute the 
slope and intercept of the line to add to a quantile-quantile plot, comparing 
sample quantiles against theoretical quantiles of a N(0, 1) distribution.

Turn this code into a function named `qq_norm` taking the sample data as an 
argument and returning the slope and intercept in a list.

Run this chunk to source the function, then run the `normal-QQ` chunk which uses 
the `qq_norm` function to compute parameters for an example plot.

---

# Excercise 2

Copy your `qq_norm` function to the `qq` chunk and rename it `qq`. 

Add a new argument `fun` to specify any quantile function (e.g. `qt`, `qf`, 
etc). Give it the default value `qnorm`. 

Inside the function use `qfun <- match.fun(fun)` to get 
the quantile function matching `fun`, then use `qfun` instead of `qnorm` 
to compute `q_theory`. Use `...` to pass on arguments to `qfun`.

Run the `qq` chunk and test your function on the `t-QQ` chunk.

---

# Using Functions From Other Packages

In our own functions (outside of packages), it is possible to use `library`

```{r}
scale_rows <- function(X){
    library(matrixStats)
    X <- X - rowMeans(X)
    X/rowSds(X)
}
```

But this loads the entire package, potentially leading to clashes with 
functions from other packages. It is better to use the **import** package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
scale_rows <- function(X){
    import::from(matrixStats, rowSds)
    X <- X - rowMeans(X)
    X/rowSds(X)
}
scale_rows(matrix(1:12, nrow = 3))
```

???

Then in our script we don't need to use `library(matrixStats)` for 
`rowSds` to work (it must be installed though)!

(`rowMeans` is in the base package)

---

# Custom ggplot

**ggplot2**, like **dplyr** and other tidyverse packages, uses 
*non-standard evaluation*, that is, it refers to variable names in a data frame as if 
they were objects in the current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y= disp)) +
    geom_point()
```

To emulate this, we have to need to **embrace** arguments

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggscatter <- function(data, x, y){
    import::from(ggplot2, ggplot, aes, geom_point)
    ggplot(data, aes(x = {{ x }}, y = {{ y }})) +
        geom_point()
}
ggscatter(mtcars, x = mpg, y = disp)
```

---

# Externalizing Function Code

It is a good idea to separate function code from analysis code.

Put related functions together and source as required
```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("modelFunctions.R")
source("plotFunctions.R")
```
The **import** package enables only necessary, top-level functions to be 
imported to the global workspace:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
import::here(poissonModel, quasiPoissonModel, .from = "modelFunctions.R")
```

In either case, `import::from` commands can be put outside the function
body to make the code easier to read.

---

# Documenting Functions

Comments help to record what a function does
```{r}
# reorder x by grouping variable g
groupSort <- function(x, g) {
    ord <- order(g) #indices for ascending order of g
    x[ord]
}
```
The **docstring** package enables *roxygen* comments to be turned into a 
help file
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(docstring)
groupSort <- function(x, g) {
    #' Reorder a Vector by a Grouping Variable
    #'
    #' @param x a vector
    #' @param g a grouping variable
    ord <- order(g) #indices for ascending order of g
    x[ord]
}
```

---

# 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?groupSort
```

For fuller documentation, see the **docstring** vignette: `vignette("docstring_intro")`.

---

# Validation

When developing a function, we will want to validate its output.

A simple approach is to try different inputs

```{r}
log_2 <- function(x){
    log(x, 2)
}
log_2(2^2)
log_2(2^0)
```
Doing this each time we change the function becomes tedious to check and 
error-prone as we miss important tests.

---

# Unit testing

The **testthat** packages allows us to create a test suite:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_that("log_2 returns log to base 2", {
    expect_equal(log_2(2^3), 3)
    expect_equal(log_2(2^0), 0)
})

test_that("negative value throws error", {
    expect_error(log_2(-1))
})
```

---

# Running Tests

If we save the tests in a file, e.g. `tests.R`, we can use `test_file()` 
to run and check all tests:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(testthat)
test_file("tests.R")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 2 ]

── Failure (tests.R:7): negative values give error ─────────────────────────────
`log_2(2^-1)` did not throw an error.

[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 2 ]")
```


---

# Exercise 3

Copy the `qq` function to a new R script and save as `functions.R`. 

Add roxygen comments at the start of the function body to define a title 
and parameter documentation.

Run the `documentation` chunk of `exercises.Rmd` to view your documentation.

---

# Exercise 4

Open the `tests.R` script. Using `expect_equal()` add some tests for the 
following

 - a sample of 100,000 from N(0, 1) gives approximately slope 1, intercept 0
 - a sample of 100,000 from N(0, 1/2) gives approximately slope 2, intercept 0
 - sample of 100,000 from N(2, 1) gives approximately slope 1, intercept -2

Use the `tol` argument in `expect_equal` to set a tolerance of 0.01.

Run the `tests` chunk of `exercises.Rmd` to run your tests with `test_file`.

Try changing the expected tolerance to get a test to fail.

# Error Handling

# Sanity Checks

To avoid mistakes, you may want to add some basic sanity checks

```{r, error = TRUE}
logit <- function(p){
    stopifnot(p > 0 & p < 1)
    log(p/(1 - p))
}
logit(2)
logit(0.5)
```

---

# Error Messages

Often the R messages can be quite obscure

```{r, error = TRUE}
zap <- function(x) if (max(x) < 1e7) 0 else x
x <- c(1, 2, NA)
zap(x)
```

More helpful error message can be implemented using `stop`

```{r, error = TRUE}
zap <- function(x) {
    if (any(is.na(x))) stop("missing values in x\nare", 
                            " not allowed")
    if (max(x) < 1e7) 0 else x
}
zap(x)
```

---

# Warning Messages

Warning messages should be given using `warning()`

```{r}
safe_log2 <- function(x) {
    if (any(x == 0)) {
        x[x == 0] <- 0.1
        warning("zeros replaced by 0.1")
    }
    log(x, 2)
}
safe_log2(0:1)
```

Other messages can be printed using `message()`.

---

# Suppressing Warnings

If a warning is expected, you may wish to suppress it

```{r}
log(c(3, -1))
x <- suppressWarnings(log(c(3, -1)))
```

All warnings will be suppressed however!

Similarly `suppressMessages()` will suppress messages.


---

# Catching Errors/Warnings

The **purrr** package has various functions to catch issues.

`possibly()` lets you modify a function to return a specified value when there 
is an error
```{r, message = FALSE, error = TRUE}
log("a")
library(purrr)
poss_log <- possibly(log, otherwise = NA)
poss_log("a")
```
`safely()` works in a similar way but returns a list with elements `"result"` 
and `"error"`, so you can record the error message(s). 

`quietly()` lets you modify a function to return printed output, warnings and 
messages along with the result.

---

# `traceback()`

When an unexpected error occurs, there are several ways to track down the source of the error, e.g. `traceback()`

```{r, error = TRUE}
f1 <- function(x){ f2(x) }
f2 <- function(x){ x + qqqq }
f1(10)
```

```{r, results = "hide"}
traceback()
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("2: f2(2) at #1\n1: f1(10)")
```

In RStudio, if "`Debug`" > "`On Error`" >  "`Error Inspector`" is checked 
and the traceback has at least 3 calls, the option to show traceback is 
presented

![RStudio error inspector giving options to show traceback or rerun with debug](error_inspector.png)
???

Note here about the importance of separating tasks into smaller functions
- easier to debug!

---

# `debugonce()`

`debugonce()` flags a function for debugging the next time it is called

```{r, results = "hide", error = TRUE}
debugonce(f2)
f1(10)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("debugging in: f2(2)\ndebug at #1: {\n    x + qqqq\n}\nBrowse[2]> ls()\n[1] \"x\"\nBrowse[2]> Q")
```

When in debug mode type `n` or <kbd title = "enter">&#8629;</kbd> to step 
to the next line and `c` to continue to the end of a loop or the end of the function.

---

# Breakpoints

Stepping through a function line by line can be tedious. In RStudio we 
can set custom breakpoints in the source pane

.pull-left[
Set breakpoint in RStudio
![](set_breakpoint.png)
]
.pull-right[
Source the code
![](debug_source.png)
]

---

<br>

Start debugging from breakpoints

![](jump_to_breakpoint.png)
???
`n` is automatically printed, so the first prompt is at the breakpoint

---

# RStudio's Rerun with Debug

The "`Rerun with Debug`" option will rerun the command that created the 
error and enter debug mode where the error occurred.

Good points:
 - Easy to enter debug mode (when option shown)
 - Can click in Traceback pane to view objects at any point in the call stack
 
Bad points:
 - May have gone past source of error (use breakpoints instead)
 - May enter deeply nested function: use `recover()` to select an earlier 
 entry point

Alternatively use `options(error = recover)`, 
run code to debug, then set `options(error = NULL)`.

---

# Exercise 5

Open the function `debug_practice.R` and source the example function `f()`.

Try to run `f(10)` - there's an error! Use `traceback()` to see which 
function call generated the error, then fix the problem. 

Run `f(10)` again - there is another error! Can you fix this directly?

Try running `f(1)` - is the result what you expected? Use `debugonce()` to 
setting debugging on `f()` and re-run `f(1)`. Step through the function,
printing each object as it is created to see what is happening.

Can you think how to improve the function? See if you can modify the 
function to give a sensible result for any integer.
