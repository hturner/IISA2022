# Advanced R Workshop, IISA 2022

Material for the [Advanced R](https://www.intindstat.org/conference2022/shortCourses) workshop held at the 2022 International Indian Statistical Association Conference, [IISA 2022] (https://www.intindstat.org/conference2022/index)

## Overview

Writing functions in R enables you to work more efficiently by writing code for re-use in routine analyses. It also equips you to run simulations and implement novel or customised methods. This workshop will provide a hands-on experience for participants to move on from the basics of writing a function in R, learning how write robust and efficient code that incorporates good software engineering practices. We will discuss how such functions could form the basis of an R package for private use or public distribution with an open source license.

## Outline

1. Writing R Functions

 * Components of a function and design considerations
 * Using functions from other packages in your functions
 * Documenting functions
 * Unit testing
 * Error Handling
 * Debugging

2. Efficient programming

 * Memory management
 * Benchmarking
 * Vectorization
 * Profiling code

3. Going further: outlook to package development

## Pre-requisites

Participants should be comfortable with handling basic data structures in R (e.g., creating/indexing vectors and matrices) and familiar with flow control (e.g. using if/else blocks of code).
